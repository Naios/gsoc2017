## Phase III - August

For the third phase of my GSoC project, I implemented the asynchronous traversal API,
which makes it possible to traverse futures inside a variadic pack while being able
to suspend the current execution context. This would be equal to a stackless coroutine.

Finally, I replaced the internal API of `wait_all` and `dataflow` with the synchronous and  asynchronous traversal API, so both interfaces are able to deal with the same set or arguments (unification).

Also duplicated code in  `wait_all` and `dataflow` was removed.
