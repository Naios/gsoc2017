## Community Bonding

During the community bonding phase, I approached some light defects in order
to get used to the codebase as well as getting to know the HPX community.
Meanwhile, I contributed to three particular fields of the HPX project:

- **Documentation improvements:**
    - invoke
    - invoke_fused
    - unwrapped
- **CMake improvements:**
    - A working directory pollution was fixed
    - Soft link creation on Windows was enabled
- **Doxygen improvements:**
    - Autolinking was fixed in some cases
    - The `detail` namespace is excluded in the documentation by default now
