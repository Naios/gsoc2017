## Community Bonding

During the community bonding phase, I approached some light defects in order
to get used to the codebase as well as getting to know the HPX community.

***

- **Documentation improvements:**
  - [`e890af420c`](https://github.com/STEllAR-GROUP/hpx/commit/e890af420c134eedcd0383c17a47223ea2865255) Add documentation to invoke_fused and invoke
  - [`9085f6b499`](https://github.com/STEllAR-GROUP/hpx/commit/9085f6b499d04bf5bb0758fd41ece9eac3a8a7f0) Add documentation to hpx::util::unwrapped and hpx::util::unwrapped2. * Also add some internal comments for improved guidance
