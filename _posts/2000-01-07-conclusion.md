## Conclusion

For me personally, Google Summer of Code was a great experience because I learned a lot about Open-Source, collaboration, and development (C++ and high-performance computing in particular).

The HPX community and maintainers (STEllAR-GROUP) were really helpful due to the whole program and provided me great support.

Special thanks go to my mentor Hartmut Kaiser who always was supportive, also he showed me the bigger picture behind the HPX framework.

I would definitely recommend others to apply for a Google Summer of Code stipend at [@STEllAR-GROUP/hpx](https://github.com/STEllAR-GROUP/hpx).
