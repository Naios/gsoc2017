### Abstract

In HPX we express dependencies between future results through the when_*, wait_* and dataflow functions, which are mostly used in combination with the unwrapped function that allows to work with plain values directly, rather than futures of values. Denis' project added the ability to those functions to also accept arbitrary containers, tuple-like objects and move only types as well as the capability to deal with futures nested inside such types. For his GSoC project, Denis re-implemented and extended the existing solution of unwrapped into an independent implementation, which provide those functionalities for synchronous and asynchronous usage. This features will make it much easier to express dependencies between futures in HPX and access its result in a convenient way.

## Overview

The following report describes the progress that I've made during my GSoC 2017 project:
"Re-implementing hpx::util::unwrapped and unifying the API of hpx::wait and hpx::when".

The main task of this project was to provide two utility APIs for traversing and mapping
objects in arbitrary variadic packs. In order to solve this task, I implemented a synchronous and an asynchronous version of the traversal API. Support for mapping across types is supported synchronously.

Both utility APIs are used to remove code duplication as well as making the APIs which unwrap or wait for futures more uniform. Additionally, the APIs introduce support for move only types as well as better support for objects which are deeply nested inside homogeneous containers (`std::vector`, `std::list`)
and tuple like containers (`std::tuple`, `hpx::util::tuple`, `std::array`).

Below you can see, for which APIs the traversal and mapping APIs replace the internal implementation:
